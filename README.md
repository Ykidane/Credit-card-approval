# Model Explainablity: explainable AI(XAI)
This project is part of my master thesis and it is about explainable AI(XAI). I used random forest model to 
predict risk applicants for a bank and used to explain the outcome of the model by LIME(Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation).

The dataset I used can be found on Kaggle.

### Model prediction: 
       - Random forest
       - Evaluation metric: out of bag estimation error rate and 10-fold cross validation
      
### Model explanation:
      - Variable importance : gini, Permutation importance
      - Partial dependency plot(PDP) 
      - LIME
