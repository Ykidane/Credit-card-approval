# Model Explainablity: explainable AI(XAI)
This project is part of my master thesis and it is about explainable AI(XAI). I used random forest model to 
predict risk applicants for a bank and used to explain the outcome of the model by using local interpreter called
LIME short for Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explainer.

The dataset I used can be found on Kaggle.

Model prediction: random forest 
      - Variable importance : gini, Permutation importance
      - Partial dependency 
Model explanation: LIME
