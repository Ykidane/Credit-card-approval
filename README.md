# Model explainablity 
This project is part of my master thesis and it is about explainable AI(XAI). I used random forest model to 
predict risk applicants for a bank and used to explain the outcome of the model by using local interpreter called
LIME short for Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explainer.
